Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

Requirements
All JavaScript code should live within the script.js file.

Step 1
Add the following starter code to your script.js file:

script.js file:

class Employee {
  constructor(name, salary, hireDate) {
    this.name = name;
    this.salary = salary;
    this.hireDate = hireDate;
  }
  getName() {
    console.log(this.name.toUpperCase());
  }
  getSalary() {
    console.log(this.salary);
  }
  getHireDate() {
    console.log(this.hireDate);
  }
}

Step 2
Create three new subclasses that inherit from the Employee parent class above:
Manager
Designer
SalesAssociate
Add the following methods to the noted subclasses:
Add the method jobDescription() to the Manager subclass
Add the method yearsExperience() to the Designer subclass
Add the method degreeCompleted() to the SalesAssociate subclass
Each new subclass should use a constructor and the super method
The Manager subclass constructor will need a new parameter: descriptionOfJob
The Designer subclass constructor will need a new parameter: experience
The SalesAssociate subclass constructor will need a new parameter: degrees
The following methods should console.log the specified sentences:
jobDescription() should console.log a sentence that provides the person's name, hire date, salary and their job description
yearsExperience() should console.log a sentence that provides the person's name, hire date, salary and their years of experience
degreeCompleted() should console.log a sentence that provides the person's name, hire date, salary and the degree they have completed
Tip!
Use the `this` keyword within the console.logs

Create one new instance of each subclass (three instances total) to define the parameters located within the constructors.
This is where the console.logs within the methods will be given actual information to console.log
Each new instance should include a name, a hire date, and a salary along with the appropriate last parameter (descriptionOfJob, experience, or degree)
An example of the end result would be "Donna was hired on 3/22/17 and makes 80000 because she manages the sales staff"
Lastly, using each of the new instances, call each of the methods that live within the respective subclasses so you can see each of the console.logs in your console.
